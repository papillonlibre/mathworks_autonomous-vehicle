# Autonomous Vehicle Object Behavior Classification

This project explores classifying object behavior (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, obstacles) to enhance the safety of autonomous driving systems. Developed as part of the MathWorks AI Studio program (Fall 2023).

## Features

Dataset preparation with annotated object behaviors

Training and evaluation of deep learning models in MATLAB/Simulink + Python/Jupyter

Experiments on behavior classification to support real-time decision making

Visualizations of predictions and model performance

## Repo Structure

Datasets_Samples/ – sample data for training/testing

ModelTrainTest/ – notebooks and scripts for model development

annotations/, train_labels/, test_labels/ – labeled data

Resources/ – supporting materials

Presentations and final deliverables (PDF, PPTX, video)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/papillonlibre/mathworks_autonomous-vehicle.git
```
2. Open notebooks in ModelTrainTest/ to reproduce training and evaluation.
3. Sample datasets are included in Datasets_Samples/.
